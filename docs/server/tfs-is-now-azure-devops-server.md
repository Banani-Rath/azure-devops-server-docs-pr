# Team Foundation Server is now called Azure DevOps Server

On November 19, 2018, Microsoft released the first release candidate (RC) of Azure DevOps Server 2019. Azure DevOps Server is the new name for the on-premises DevOps server product previously called Team Foundation Server.

This new release brings many of the newest features from the cloud-hosted [Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops) into the on-premises server product. Azure DevOps Services was formerly called [Visual Studio Team Services](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-happened-vsts).
