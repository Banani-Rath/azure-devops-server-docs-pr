[!INCLUDE [temp](../_shared/version-tfs-all-versions.md)]

Install, upgrade, or manage your on-premises deployment of Azure DevOps Server, previously named Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS), with the guidance provided here. 
Azure DevOps provides integrated tools to support collaborative software development, including Git repositories, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and interactive Kanban boards.

To evaluate Azure DevOps, you can install Azure DevOps Express or sign up for our cloud offering, Azure DevOps Services for free. To learn more, see [Installations for evaluation or personal use](../install/get-started.md).

For production-level on-premise deployments, review the requirements and architecture articles. 

If you're a new Azure DevOps administrator, see [Get started as an administrator in Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/user-guide/project-admin-tutorial) and [Administrative tasks quick reference](../admin/admin-quick-ref.md).
