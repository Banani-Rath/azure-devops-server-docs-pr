# Team Foundation Server is now called Azure DevOps Server

[!INCLUDE [temp](_shared/version-tfs-all-versions.md)]

On September 10, 2018, Microsoft renamed Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to [Azure DevOps Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/what-happened-vsts?view=azure-devops). With Azure DevOps Server 2019, Microsoft is renaming Visual Studio Team Foundation Server to Azure DevOps Server. For more information on this change, see [Introducing Azure DevOps Server](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-devops/).

This new release brings many of the newest features from the cloud-hosted [Azure DevOps Services](/azure/devops) into the on-premises server product. Azure DevOps Services was formerly called [Visual Studio Team Services](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-happened-vsts).

To learn more about Azure DevOps Server, see the following articles:

Where possible, we recommend using our cloud offering, Azure DevOps. For more information, see [Azure DevOps Services vs. Azure DevOps Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/user-guide/about-azure-devops-services-tfs?view=azure-devops). If you are currently using TFS or Azure DevOps Server, you can move from on-premises to the cloud and [bring your data along](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/migrate/).
