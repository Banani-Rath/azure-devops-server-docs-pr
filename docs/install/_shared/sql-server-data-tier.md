You'll need to [open port 1433](/sql/sql-server/install/configure-the-windows-firewall-to-allow-sql-server-access)
so that the application-tier server can connect to the SQL Server database engine.

If you're going to enable reporting,
install SQL Server Analysis Services and install and configure SQL Server Reporting Services, too.
