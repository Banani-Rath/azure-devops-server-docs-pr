# Azure DevOps and Team Foundation Server (TFS)

On **September 5th, 2018**, Visual Studio Team Services, the cloud-hosted set of software collaboration and DevOps services, became **Azure DevOps Services**.

Many of the featured services in VSTS are now offered as standalone ones:

|VSTS/TFS feature        |Azure DevOps service |
|------------------------|---------------------|
|Code (Git and TFVC))    | Azure Repos         |
|Work                    | Azure Boards        |
|Build and release       | Azure Pipelines     |
|Test                    | Azure Test Plans    |
|Packages (extension)    | Azure Artifacts     |

As a result, we support two versions of the user interface in documentation: The older, horizontal navigation used by TFS 2018 and earlier; and the new, vertical, service-oriented navigation used by Azure DevOps. The Azure DevOps documentation, which covers both Azure DevOps Services and TFS scenarios and reference, commonly uses the latest versions of the common UI in its guidance. 

TFS documentation is embedded in the Azure DevOps documentation. You can toggle to it by selecting the version selector dropdown in the upper-left of a documentation page.
